## ⚠️ **REQUIRES CLARIFICATION**

### Neurotransmitter Mechanisms
**Claim in Article:** "Helps balance neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine"

**Review:** 
- ⚠️ **Mechanism is complex:** TMS effects on neurotransmitters are indirect
- ⚠️ **More accurate:** "Influences neurotransmitter systems including serotonin and dopamine"
- ⚠️ **Evidence:** Mechanism not fully understood; multiple pathways involved

**Recommendation:** Language is acceptable for patient education but could be more precise

**Status:** ⚠️ ACCEPTABLE but consider revision to: "May help influence neurotransmitter systems"

---

### "Wake Up" Underactive Areas
**Claim in Article:** "Helps wake up those areas"

**Review:**
- ⚠️ **Colloquial language:** Appropriate for patient education
- ⚠️ **More accurate:** "Increases neural activity in underactive regions"
- ⚠️ **Evidence:** fMRI studies show increased activity in targeted regions

**Recommendation:** Language is patient-friendly and conceptually accurate

**Status:** ✅ ACCEPTABLE for lay audience
