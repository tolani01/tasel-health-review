Tasel Health was created to change this—we're building a TMS-specialized psychiatric clinic that brings together the best of neuroscience (BrainsWay Deep TMS™), evidence-based psychiatry, and compassionate counseling all under one roof. Our goal is to establish ourselves as a national leader in depression treatment while providing comprehensive psychiatric services, making world-class mental health care accessible, coordinated, and effective. We exist because mental health care shouldn't require people to navigate multiple providers, wait months for appointments, or settle for incomplete treatment—we're here to change that.

### Suggestion 2 (Strategic/Vision-Focused):
Tasel Health exists to become the national standard for TMS-specialized psychiatric care. We're building a specialized clinic that combines the precision of advanced TMS therapy (BrainsWay Deep TMS™) with comprehensive psychiatry services to create integrated treatment solutions. Our mission is to establish ourselves as a recognized national leader in depression treatment while offering the full spectrum of psychiatric services. We're solving the industry-wide problem of fragmented mental health care by bringing TMS therapy, medication management, and counseling together in one coordinated, evidence-based approach. By starting in Oklahoma City and expanding strategically, we're positioning Tasel Health to be the go-to destination for patients seeking cutting-edge depression treatment and comprehensive psychiatric care.

## Question 6: Competitors - The things you do better than anyone in the market.

### Suggestion 1 (Strategic Differentiators):
What we do better than anyone:

**1. True Integration Under One Roof**  
While most competitors offer fragmented care (TMS in one place, psychiatry in another, therapy somewhere else), we're the only TMS-specialized psychiatric clinic that brings BrainsWay Deep TMS™, medication management, and counseling all under one roof with a coordinated care team. Our providers communicate, collaborate, and coordinate—not just in the same building, but as a unified team. This eliminates the fragmented care problem that plagues most mental health practices.

**2. TMS Specialization + Comprehensive Psychiatry**  
Most TMS centers are TMS-only. Most psychiatric practices don't offer TMS. We're uniquely positioned as a TMS-specialized psychiatric clinic—combining deep TMS expertise with comprehensive psychiatric services. This means we're the experts in both advanced brain stimulation and traditional psychiatric care, giving patients the best of both worlds.

**3. Same-Week Access**  
While competitors often have 6-12 week wait times for psychiatric appointments, we offer same-week consultations. This removes the barrier of long wait times that prevents people from getting the help they need when they need it.

**4. BrainsWay Deep TMS™ Technology**  
We use BrainsWay Deep TMS™, which reaches deeper brain structures (up to 6cm) than traditional TMS. This technology provides more comprehensive treatment for a wider range of conditions, and we're specialists in using it effectively.

**5. Coordinated Care, Not Just Convenience**  
Many places offer multiple services, but they operate as separate practices. We're the only clinic where TMS specialists, psychiatrists, and therapists truly coordinate as one team—sharing insights, aligning treatment plans, and ensuring continuity. This team-based approach leads to better outcomes than any single treatment alone.

---

Our providers actively communicate and collaborate, ensuring all treatments work together seamlessly. This integrated approach achieves better outcomes than any single treatment alone.

**2. TMS-Specialized with Full Psychiatric Services**  
We're uniquely positioned as a TMS-specialized psychiatric clinic—combining cutting-edge BrainsWay Deep TMS™ expertise with comprehensive psychiatric services. While most TMS centers are TMS-only and most psychiatric practices don't offer TMS, we're the experts in both, giving patients access to advanced treatments without sacrificing traditional care.

**3. Accessibility and Speed**  
We solve the accessibility problem: same-week consultations (vs. competitors' 6-12 week waits), accept most insurance plans, offer telehealth options, and make advanced treatments accessible. We're removing the barriers that prevent people from getting quality mental health care.

**4. Advanced Technology + Proven Results**  
We use BrainsWay Deep TMS™ technology that reaches deeper brain structures than traditional TMS, with a 75% success rate for depression treatment. Our evidence-based protocols are backed by research, and we continuously track outcomes to ensure we're delivering the highest quality care.

**5. Coordinated Team Approach**  
Our TMS specialists, psychiatrists, and therapists work as one unified team—not as separate practices sharing a building. We coordinate regularly, share insights, align treatment plans, and ensure continuity of care. This team-based coordination is something most competitors simply cannot match because they operate as separate entities.
